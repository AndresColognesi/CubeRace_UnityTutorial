# Cube Race - Unity Tutorial

This is a simple cube collision game developed by following [this Unity basics tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL).

The game essentially consists in a controlling a cube while it rushes through a platform of obstacles. If any obstacle is hit or the cube falls from the platform, the level is restarted. By reaching the end of each level, the next one can be started.
